This app uses predictive traffic conditions to calculate the best route through several 
locations factoring in time spent at each place.

A common use case is someone needs to run some errands, and does not know what store to go to first.

Another popular use case is when you are driving several friends home and want to figure out the optimal order in
which to drop them off, factoring in that Jimmy alwasy takes forever to unload his things.

The main purpose of this app was to use Google's AdMob and to get data structure pracice, and to practice building a
 shortest path algorithm. The use of predictive traffic data makes the shortest path algorithm rather tricky as 
 the travel time between locations is variable depending on the departure time. This variation significantly complicates
 the problem.
